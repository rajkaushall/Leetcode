# 🍎 Number of Unplaced Fruits

You are given two arrays:

- `fruits[]`: each element represents a fruit type.
- `baskets[]`: each basket can hold only one specific type of fruit.

🧠 Your task is to find **how many fruits cannot be placed in any basket**.

---

## 📥 Input

`fruits = [4, 2, 5]`  
`baskets = [3, 5, 4]`

## 📤 Output

`1`

---

## 📘 Explanation

We have 3 fruits:  
- 4 → can go in basket 4  
- 2 → ❌ no basket for fruit 2  
- 5 → can go in basket 5  

So, only fruit 2 cannot be placed.  
Hence, the answer is `1`.

---

## 🪜 Approach

1. Initialize a counter `count` to total number of fruits.
2. Track which baskets are used using a boolean vector `bas`.
3. For each fruit:
   - Check if there's any unused basket that matches the fruit.
   - If matched:
     - Mark that basket as used.
     - Decrease the count.
4. Return the final `count` as number of **unplaced fruits**.

## 💻 C++ Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfUnplacedFruits(vector<int>& fruits, vector<int>& baskets) {
        int n = baskets.size();
        int count = fruits.size(); // total fruits
        vector<bool> bas(n, false); // to track used baskets

        for (int i = 0; i < fruits.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (baskets[j] == fruits[i] && bas[j] == false) {
                    bas[j] = true;
                    count--; // this fruit is placed
                    break;   // move to next fruit
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
